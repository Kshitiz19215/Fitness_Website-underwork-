# Python_intern_underwork
In this project, we used Flask, a Python web framework, to build a basic web application. We created multiple HTML templates for different pages, such as the homepage, about page, workouts page, nutrition page, and contact page. Flask routes were set up to handle different URLs and render the appropriate HTML templates.
